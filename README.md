# JournalBay

        Journal Bay is a Journal App. It serves as a diary where you can add notes, view notes, edit and delete a note.
        Important notes can also be pinned to the top. 
        Users can register and login using Google account. 
        To delete a note from the notes list, you swipe to the left. Swiping to the right lets you edit the note.
